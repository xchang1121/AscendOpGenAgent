PostToolUse hook for Bash — phase auto-advancement after user-issued commands.

The only commands that advance phase from this hook are those Claude runs
directly via the Bash tool:
  - `export AR_TASK_DIR=...`  → activate task, compute starting phase
                                (fresh task always lands at BASELINE; both
                                reference.py and kernel.py are guaranteed
                                present because /autoresearch requires both)
  - `baseline.py`             → PLAN on success or on kernel_fail;
                                infra_fail leaves phase untouched
  - `pipeline.py`             → whatever phase pipeline.py itself wrote
  - `create_plan.py`          → EDIT on plan validation pass
                                (called from PLAN / DIAGNOSE / REPLAN)

The inner pipeline steps (quick_check subprocess + in-process run_eval +
in-process record_round + settle subprocess) run beneath pipeline.py and
never re-enter this hook, so they don't need their own phase constants
or branches here.
